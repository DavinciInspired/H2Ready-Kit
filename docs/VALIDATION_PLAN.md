# Validation and Benchmarking Plan

This document outlines how H2Ready can be validated against:

- Laboratory hydrogen test data (K_TH, fatigue tests)
- Field trial data from hydrogen blend or dedicated hydrogen pilots
- Synthetic datasets created from parametric studies

The goal is to demonstrate that HRI scores and classes behave consistently with physical expectations
and evolving standards.
