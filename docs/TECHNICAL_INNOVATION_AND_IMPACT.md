# H2Ready and Technical innovation Impact

This repository demonstrates:

- Original technical contribution in the hydrogen readiness space
- Combination of domain-specific engineering (pipelines, fracture mechanics, CP, integrity)
  with software and data architecture (FastAPI, Streamlit, Postgres, Docker)
- A clear roadmap towards advanced ML (Level‑2 and Level‑3) and uncertainty quantification
- Professional documentation (RP, white paper, software specification)
