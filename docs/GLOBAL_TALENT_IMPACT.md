# H2Ready and Global Talent Impact

This repository demonstrates:

- Original technical contribution in the hydrogen readiness space
- Combination of domain-specific engineering (pipelines, fracture mechanics, CP, integrity)
  with software and data architecture (FastAPI, Streamlit, Postgres, Docker)
- A clear roadmap towards advanced ML (Level‑2 and Level‑3) and uncertainty quantification
- Professional documentation (RP, white paper, software specification)

For Global Talent or similar programmes, you may point to:

- Architecture and spec in `docs/H2Ready_Software_Prototype_Specification_Full.docx`
- The prototype implementation in `backend/` and `frontend/`
- The hydrogen readiness RP and white paper
- Evidence of leadership (designing the framework, owning the repo and authorship)
